# ***AHB Direct Access Memory Controller (DMAC)***

## **Introduction**
Direct Memory Access Controller is used to allow the peripherals to directly transfer data to their required destination i.e. Memory or another peripheral without disrupting the processor. This saves the processor from handling lenghty transfers because when a CPU handles data transfers, it remains blocked and can't perform instructions. This transfer can take many cycles so to avoid this, the transfer is handed over to the DMAC along with the control of the Bus. DMAC handles the transfer while the CPU can deal with other tasks and instructions. A DMAC has two types of transfers:
- Burst Transfer
- Single Transfer

In a Burst Transfer, data is buffered in a FIFO untill burst size is reached and then transfered one-by-one untill the FIFO is empty.

### **Working:**
This DMAC has been designed as to follow a certain pipeline to complete the transfer. The pipeline is as follows:

1. First of all, peripheral requests for a transfer to DMAC.
    1. Priority is given to the DmacReq[1] which Enables Channel 1 to handle the transfer.
    2. If both bits of DmacReq are asserted, DMAC ignores DmacReq[0] signal and doesn't assert its request acknowledge signal.
2. After the Request, DMAC asserts Hold and waits for CPU to configure the Slave Interface. Along with Hold, DMAC also Requests for Bus. Request remains asserted until Bus is granted.
    1. The Sequence in which slave registers should be configured are:
       1. Size Register
       2. Source Address (SAddr) Register
       3. Destination Address (DAddr) Register
       4. Control (Ctrl) Register
    2. Control Register Contains a C_Config bit which, when asserted, tells the DMAC that its Slave has been configured. Ctrl Register is Reset (to zero) after IRQ is generated by the channel.
3. Slave Gets Configured, i.e. C_config signal gets asserted.
4. DMAC waits for Bus Grant.
5. After the DMAC is granted the bus, DMAC asserts the ReqAck bit corresponding to the DmacReq bit which results in Deassertion of DmacReq bit by the slave.
6. Corresponding to DmacReq, the channel is enabled i.e. Channel 1 is used for DmacReq[1] and has the highest priority. Whereas, Channel 2 is for DmacReq[0] bit.
7. After the channel has been enabled, Now the DMAC waits for IRQ which signals transfer completion from the channel's side. During the transfer, it is important to decide which channel should output the data to the master interface. To do that, a mux is used with con_sel signal as selector. This con_sel is also given to a FlipFlop and the output of the FlipFlop is the input to the controller of the DMAC, which informs which channel was enabled previously. 0 means channel 1, 1 means channel 2.
8. Once IRQ is asserted, DMAC asserts the Interrupt to signal the CPU about the completion of transfer, that means the CPU can take the Bus access.

## DMAC Channel
### Description: 
The DMAC (Direct Memory Access Controller) channel is responsible for autonomously transferring data between a source and destination without CPU intervention. It is designed to support both single transfers (one word per transaction) and burst transfers (multiple words per transaction), providing flexibility for various use cases.

Each channel includes a dedicated FIFO buffer, which temporarily holds data during burst operations. Once the data has been successfully transferred, the channel automatically generates an interrupt to notify the CPU that the operation is complete.

### Operation

The DMA channel operates through a **finite state machine (FSM)** that governs the control and flow of data. The following outlines the step-by-step operation:

---

### Configuration
- When a **transfer request** is received from a peripheral, the CPU configures the DMAC by writing to the following registers:
  - `SAddr_Reg`: Source memory address
  - `DAddr_Reg`: Destination memory address
  - `Size_Reg`: Total number of bytes or words to transfer
  - `Ctrl_Reg`: Burst size and other control/configuration bits

---

### Start Condition
- The transfer begins when the **`channel_en`** signal for the selected channel is asserted.
- The FSM transitions from the **IDLE** state to the **ENABLED** state.
- During this transition, the following internal registers are loaded from the previously configured values:
  - `Src_Addr`: Latched source address
  - `Dst_Addr`: Latched destination address
  - `Size_Reg`: Size of the transfer
  - `Burst_Size`: Number of words to be transferred per burst

---

### Data Transfer
- Once enabled:
  - The DMA channel issues a **read request** to the source address and increments the source address.
  - Upon receiving valid data, it stores it in the **FIFO**.
  - Then, a **write request** is issued to the destination address and destination address is incremented.
- In **burst mode**, multiple data items are read in chunks, temporarily buffered in the FIFO, and then written sequentially.
- This process repeats until the **entire configured transfer size** is completed.

---

### Completion
- After the final data word is transferred:
  - The FSM returns to the **IDLE** state.
  - The DMA channel asserts an **interrupt signal** to the CPU to indicate successful completion.

| `Burst_Size`         | 32    | Number of words to be transferred per burst                                 |
| `Decrement_Counter`  | 32    | Tracks the remaining number of data items to be read or written in the current burst. It decrements with each successful transfer and resets to `Burst_Size` at the start of every new read or write burst. |
