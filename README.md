## **Introduction**
A Direct Memory Access Controller (DMAC) is a hardware module designed to facilitate efficient data transfers between memory and peripherals, or between two peripheral devices, without heavily involving the processor (CPU). This mechanism allows data movement to occur in the background, freeing the CPU to execute other instructions or handle high-priority tasks.

When the CPU is tasked with handling data transfers directly, it typically becomes blocked â€” it must wait and perform each individual read and write operation. This process consumes valuable processor cycles and significantly hampers overall system performance, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. To alleviate this bottleneck, the DMAC takes over the responsibility of managing the transfer and temporarily gains control of the system bus.

Once granted control, the DMAC autonomously carries out the data transfer between source and destination addresses using its own internal logic. After completing the transfer, it relinquishes the bus back to the CPU, generating an interrupt to signal completion.

***Transfer Types:*** DMAC supports two fundamental types of data transfers:

- **Burst Transfer**
In burst mode, the DMAC collects data into a FIFO buffer. Once the buffer reaches the defined burst size, transfer starts. Data is sent in a continuous sequence without interruption. This reduces bus arbitration and improves throughput. Best suited for large data blocks or high-speed devices. However, it can monopolize the bus during the burst. Careful arbitration is needed in multi-master systems.

- **Single Transfer**
In single mode, one data item is moved at a time. It is used when a peripheral only has 1 word to transfer. Ideal for low-latency or real-time applications. Overhead is higher due to repeated bus arbitration. More predictable and fair in shared-bus environments. Recommended for small or sporadic data transfers.

### **Working Pipeline:**
This DMAC has been designed as to follow a certain pipeline to complete the transfer. The pipeline is as follows:
<div align='center'>
    <img src='docs/DMAC_Pipeline.png'>
</div>

#### **Request from Peripheral**
First of all, peripheral requests for a transfer to DMAC.
1. Priority is given to the `DmacReq[1]` which Enables `Channel 1` to handle the transfer.
2. If both bits of DmacReq are asserted, DMAC ignores `DmacReq[0]` signal and doesn't assert its request acknowledge signal `ReqAck[1]`.
3. `Channel 2` is used for `DmacReq[0]`.

---

#### **Slave Configuration**
After the Request, DMAC asserts Hold and waits for CPU to configure the Slave Interface. Along with Hold, DMAC also Requests for Bus. Bus Request remains asserted until Bus is granted.
1. The Sequence in which slave registers should be configured are:
   1. `Size_Reg`
   2. `SAddr_Reg`
   3. `DAddr_Reg`
   4. `Ctrl_Reg`
2. Control Register Contains a `c_config` bit which, when asserted, tells the DMAC that its Slave has been configured. `Ctrl Reg` is Reset (to zero) after `irq` is generated by the channel.
3. Slave Gets Configured, i.e. `c_config` signal gets asserted.
4. DMAC waits for Bus Grant.

---

#### **Enabling Channels**
1. After the DMAC is granted the bus, DMAC asserts the `ReqAck `bit corresponding to the `DmacReq` bit which results in deassertion of `DmacReq` bit by the slave/peripheral.
2. Corresponding to `DmacReq`, the channel is enabled i.e. `Channel 1` is used for `DmacReq[1]` and has the highest priority.Whereas, `Channel 2` is for `DmacReq[0]` bit.

---

#### **Transfer Completion and Disabling DMAC**
1. After the channel has been enabled, Now the DMAC waits for `irq` which signals transfer completion from the channel's side. During the transfer, it is important to decide which channel should output the data to the master interface. To do that, a mux is used with `con_sel` signal as selector. This `con_sel` is also given to a FlipFlop and the output of the FlipFlop, `new_con_sel` is the input to the controller of the DMAC, which informs which channel was enabled previously. `0` means `channel 1`, `1` means `channel 2`.
2. Once `irq` is asserted, DMAC asserts the `Interrupt` flag to signal the CPU about the completion of transfer, that means the CPU can take the Bus access.

### Description: 
The DMAC (Direct Memory Access Controller) channel is responsible for autonomously transferring data between a source and destination without CPU intervention. It is designed to support both single transfers (one word per transaction) and burst transfers (multiple words per transaction), providing flexibility for various use cases.

Each channel includes a dedicated FIFO buffer, which temporarily holds data during burst operations. Once the data has been successfully transferred, the channel automatically generates an interrupt to notify the CPU that the operation is complete.

### Working Pipeline: 

<div align='center'>
  <img src='docs/DMAC_Channel_Pipeline.png'>
</div>

#### Operation

The DMA channel operates through a **finite state machine (FSM)** that governs the control and flow of data. The following outlines the step-by-step operation:

---

#### Configuration
- When a **transfer request** is received from a peripheral, the CPU configures the DMAC by writing to the following registers:
  - `SAddr_Reg`: Source memory address
  - `DAddr_Reg`: Destination memory address
  - `Size_Reg`: Total number of bytes or words to transfer
  - `Ctrl_Reg`: Burst size and other control/configuration bits

---

#### Start Condition
- The transfer begins when the **`channel_en`** signal for the selected channel is asserted.
- The FSM transitions from the **IDLE** state to the **ENABLED** state.
- During this transition, the following internal registers are loaded from the previously configured values:
  - `Src_Addr`: Latched source address
  - `Dst_Addr`: Latched destination address
  - `Size_Reg`: Size of the transfer
  - `Burst_Size`: Number of words to be transferred per burst

---

#### Data Transfer
- Once enabled:
  - The DMA channel issues a **read request** to the source address and increments the source address.
  - Upon receiving valid data, it stores it in the **FIFO**.
  - Then, a **write request** is issued to the destination address and destination address is incremented.
- In **burst mode**, multiple data items are read in chunks, temporarily buffered in the FIFO, and then written sequentially.
- This process repeats until the **entire configured transfer size** is completed.
- If the `transfer_size` is an exact multiple of the `burst_size`, the entire data is transferred using burst transfers. Otherwise, the largest possible number of full bursts are used, and the remaining data (`transfer_size % burst_size`) is transferred using single transfers.
- **Writing Strobe Signal - MWSTRB:** During **writing**, to indicate which `byte` (when `HSize` = `byte`) or which `halfword` (when `HSize` = `halfword`) is valid in the word being transferred, `MWSTRB` signal is used.
Here's a table to link each combination of `MWSTRB` to the bytes of a word, indicating which one is valid.

|Data Size|Address Offset|MWSTRB|HWDATA[31:24]|HWDATA[23:16]|HWDATA[15:8]|HWDATA[7:0]|
|----|-----|-----|-----|-----|----|-----|
|`word`|`0`|`1111`|Valid|Valid|Valid|Valid|
|`halfword`|`0`|`0011`|||Valid|Valid|
|`halfword`|`2`|`1100`|Valid|Valid|||
|`byte`|`0`|`0001`||||Valid|
|`byte`|`1`|`0010`|||Valid||
|`byte`|`2`|`0100`||Valid|||
|`byte`|`3`|`1000`|Valid||||

---

#### Completion
- After the final data word is transferred:
  - The FSM returns to the **IDLE** state.
  - The DMA channel asserts an **interrupt signal** to the CPU to indicate successful completion.
